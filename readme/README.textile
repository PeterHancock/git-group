h1. GIT GROUP

The problem this script solves is nicely described at
"Multiple working folders with single GIT repository":http://finik.net/2010/10/24/multiple-working-folders-with-single-git-repository/

The solution is more or less a copy of that.

h2. Installation

Add the _bin_ directory to your path

h2. Usage

To create a git group in the current directory, _GROUP-DIR_

bc. git group <REPO URL>

To create a new working copy _WC_

bc. cd GROUP-DIR
git group-add WC
